A simple privacy preserving voice transcription app using whisper-turbo-mlx (based on the whisper-turbo-mlx project by [@jiaaro](https://github.com/jiaaro)), optimized for Apple Silicon Macs. Creates a little button to record audio and get instant transcription to your clipboard. No data leaves your machine. Minimal processing time and then you have the transcript in your clipboard and can paste it wherever you want. It just works, also for longer audio (chunking).


## Features

- Simple one-button interface
- Visual feedback (green/red/orange) for recording status
- Uses whisper-turbo-mlx for fast, local transcription
- Supports unlimited recording duration through audio chunking
- Automatically copies transcription to clipboard
- Optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Supports multiple languages automatically
